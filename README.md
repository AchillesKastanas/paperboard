# Paperboard - Note-Taking SPA

## Overview

**Paperboard** is a simple and responsive single-page application (SPA) built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. The app allows users to create, delete, edit titles, and manage their notes in a grid layout. Additionally, users can export their notes as a JSON file.

### Features:

- **Create, Edit, Delete, and Export Notes**: Manage your notes easily.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.
- **Animations**: Notes are animated with **Framer Motion** for a smooth user experience.
- **Context API**: Used for centralized state management to track note updates.
- **Export Notes**: Users can export notes as a JSON file.
- **Dockerized**: The app is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework that allows for server-side rendering and static site generation. Chosen for its simplicity, performance optimizations, and built-in support for React and TypeScript.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and helps in detecting errors early in the development process.
- **TailwindCSS**: Used for styling, providing utility-first CSS classes for fast UI development.
- **Framer Motion**: Used for animating notes and providing smooth transitions.
- **Context API**: To manage state globally across the app.
- **Jest**: Attempted unit testing (ran into configuration issues).
- **Docker**: The app is dockerized for easy deployment.

## Project Structure

- **Logo**: Displayed in the top-left corner, leading to the homepage.
- **Header**: Contains the title and basic navigation.
- **Grid**: Notes are displayed in a responsive grid layout using the TailwindCSS grid system.
- **Footer**: A simple footer at the bottom of the page.
  
## Design Decisions

1. **Framework Choice**:
   - **Next.js** was chosen over other frameworks (like ViteJS or vanilla JS) due to its robust features, such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and built-in routing. The development experience with Next.js is smooth and highly optimized for React.
   
2. **State Management**:
   - **Context API** was chosen to manage the global state for notes. It allows centralized state management, making it easier to track changes and keep the UI in sync with the appâ€™s state.

3. **Styling**:
   - **TailwindCSS** was selected for its flexibility and efficiency in writing utility-first CSS. It allows rapid prototyping and responsive design.
   - The **Grid System** was applied to manage the layout of notes dynamically.

4. **Animation**:
   - **Framer Motion** was used for animating note elements. Each note has a simple animation that triggers when it is added or removed from the grid.

5. **Testing**:
   - **Jest** was set up for unit testing components. However, I ran into some configuration issues, which prevented full implementation of tests.
   
6. **Docker**:
   - The application is Dockerized to simplify deployment and ensure consistency across different environments.
   
7. **Versioning**:
   - Semantic versioning is applied, with the final version being **v1.2.0**. The commit history follows conventional commits, such as:
     - `feat`: For adding new features.
     - `chore`: For tasks like dependency management.
     - `fix`: For fixing bugs.

## Features & Bonuses Implemented

1. **Main Features**:
   - Create, edit, delete notes.
   - Export notes to a JSON file.
   - Responsive design with TailwindCSS.
   - Context API for centralized state management.
   - Grid layout for displaying notes.
   - Dockerized for easy deployment.

2. **Bonus Features**:
   - **Framer Motion Animations**: Notes animate on creation and deletion for better user experience.
   - **Docker**: Deployed in a Docker container for easy setup and testing.
   - **Jest**: Initial setup for testing (though not fully functional due to configuration issues).

3. **Potential API Implementation**:
   - Although an API could be implemented to sync the state with a server (for storing notes remotely), this feature was not implemented due to time constraints.

## Setup Instructions

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the development server.
4. To run the app in production mode (after building).

### Docker:

To run the app in Docker:
1. Build the Docker image.
2. Run the Docker container.

## Testing

- **Jest** is set up for unit testing components, though due to configuration issues, the tests were not fully implemented.

## Semantic Versioning & Commit History

- This project follows **semantic versioning**. The current version is **v1.2.0**.
- The commit history follows **conventional commits**:
  - `feat`: New features.
  - `chore`: Miscellaneous tasks like dependency updates.
  - `fix`: Bug fixes.

## Final Thoughts

Paperboard is a simple, responsive note-taking app built using modern web development tools. While I wasn't able to fully implement unit tests or the server-side syncing functionality, the core features of the app are fully functional, and Docker has been implemented for easy deployment.

I hope this project serves as a solid foundation for future enhancements, such as adding server-side APIs for note synchronization and fully integrated testing.

Feel free to explore the project and suggest improvements!
